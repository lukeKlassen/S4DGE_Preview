`Raycast4D.cs` is the initialization script for the scene.
`RayTracingStructs.cginc` contains all common structs
`RayTracing.hlsl` contains code regarding the shader/actual raycasting

### Common Shapes

`RayTraced<Shape>` - script that is to be used in the scene
`<Shape>` - Shape that is actually defined
